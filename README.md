# crapfilter
Chat filtering for World of Warcraft v1.12.1

# Introduction
I've tried a bunch of different addons for 1.12 and found none working or simply lacking features,
thus CrapFilter was born

# Commands
**/cf** or **/crapfilter** invokes the addon
* add - adds a phrase to the filter
* del - deletes a phrase from the filter
* reset - deletes all phrases from the filter
* info - shows stats
* list - shows the whole filter
